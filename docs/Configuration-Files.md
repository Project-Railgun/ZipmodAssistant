# Configuration Files

Beyond the manifest.xml mod creators are taxed with creating, there is an additional file type that may allow for an easier time creating mods.

An example of a configuration file looks like so:

```toml
guid = "me.itsspyce.example"
name = "Example Mod"
version = "1.0.0"
website = "https://github.com/Project-Railgun/ZipmodAssistant"
description = """
An example mod using Zipmod Assistant
"""
games = ["kk", "kks"]

[author]
name = "ItsSpyce"
website = "https://github.com/ItsSpyce"
```
